## Summary
The human brain is designed to process vast amounts of input that are continuously gathered through the senses. However, most experiments study the brain via simplified stimuli that do not resemble the complexity of a natural environment — a mismatch that needs to be addressed in order to better understand how the brain works in its daily, stimuli-rich environments. This project aims to provide essential components to enable inter-disciplinary research to study the brain’s natural behavior and the versatile interactions of concurrent cognitive processes in everyday life.

We provide extensive functional brain imaging data from natural stimulation, a rich set of auxiliary data, (such as structural brain scans, measurements of physiological, and technical confounds), as well as stimulus annotations.

We invite research groups and individuals to participate in a contest to kick-start a mass-collaboration on studying the brain in its natural environment. Among all submissions that are received until November 1 2014 a jury will determine the best contributions in terms of novelty of the approach, scientific rigor, and potential impact on future research and application. The best three contributions will receive an award (3000, 1500, and 500 Euro respectively) sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences, Magdeburg, Germany. For details, please see the website.
