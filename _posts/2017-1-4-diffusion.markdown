## Summary
During Montreal Brainhack EDT some of the Diffusion Imaging in Python (Dipy) developers (Eleftherios, Marc-Alex and Etienne) will be available to help people learn how to analyze diffusion MRI data with the latest state-of-the-art methods available in Dipy! So, bring your datasets!

Additionally, for people who already know how to code in Python we will work during the Hackathon to extend the segmentation and visualization capabilities of Dipy. Other ideas are welcome too. Join us and share your code and ideas!
