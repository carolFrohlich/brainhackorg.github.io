## Summary
The Spinal Cord Toolbox is the first software for processing multiparametric MRI of the spinal cord. The primary step is the automatic segmentation of the spinal cord, and is currently performed by PropSeg (https://sourceforge.net/p/spinalcordtoolbox/wiki/sct_propseg/).

We would like to improve the robustness of our spinal cord segmentation method, by increasing the accuracy of the spinal cord detection. One way to do that is to develop an automatic centerline extraction method.

The method must be developed in Python or C++ and can be tested on large datasets with various fields of view.
